# Gas Station Management System

## Project Overview

This Java-based application serves as a comprehensive sales management system for a gas station and convenience store. Developed as part of the 'Advanced Object-Oriented Programming' course at Coll√®ge LaSalle, the project integrates key concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and exception handling.

## Introduction

The Gas Station Management System is designed to efficiently handle sales operations at a gas station, including the sale of gas, chocolate bars, sandwiches, and coffee. Each edible item has an expiry date, and gas transactions are tracked through a gauge that monitors the station's fuel levels.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following structure:

- **Assignment3**: Main project folder
  - **src/main/java/ca/college/lasalle**: Source code location

## Features

- **Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Interfaces:** Implemented to create a robust and extensible design.
- **Exception Handling:** Custom exception class (`InvalidCalories`) is used to manage calorie-related errors.
- **ArrayList Usage:** All items sold by the gas station, including gas, are managed in a single ArrayList.
- **Comparable Interface:** Implementations for comparing chocolate bars and sandwiches based on specified criteria.
- **CRUD Operations:** Supports adding, selling, and displaying items, as well as monitoring gas levels.

## Usage

The system provides a user-friendly menu for various operations:

1. Add a chocolate bar
2. Add a sandwich
3. Add gas
4. Add coffee
5. Display all chocolate bars
6. Compare two chocolate bars by healthiness
7. Display all sandwiches
8. Compare two sandwiches by price
9. Sell an edible item
10. Sell gas
11. Sell coffee
12. Display gas levels
13. Exit
