Introduction
The Gas Station Management System is designed to efficiently handle sales operations at a gas station, including the sale of gas, chocolate bars, sandwiches, and coffee. Each edible item has an expiry date, and gas transactions are tracked through a gauge that monitors the station's fuel levels.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following structure:

Assignment3: Main project folder
src/main/java/ca/college/lasalle: Source code location

Features
Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Interfaces: Implemented to create a robust and extensible design.
Exception Handling: Custom exception class (InvalidCalories) is used to manage calorie-related errors.
ArrayList Usage: All items sold by the gas station, including gas, are managed in a single ArrayList.
Comparable Interface: Implementations for comparing chocolate bars and sandwiches based on specified criteria.
CRUD Operations: Supports adding, selling, and displaying items, as well as monitoring gas levels.
